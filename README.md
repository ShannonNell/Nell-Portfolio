# Challenge 2: Portfolio

## Description
A website to showcase my personal portfolio that can evolve as I progress in my studies. Initial design for the website is based off of a provided mock-up example on the websites appearance and funcitonality.

Used flexboxes to style layout, media queries to ensure responsiveness to multiple screen sizes, and advanced pseudo classes to add depth to the page.
