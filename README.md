### Task:
Build portfolio of work samples

### Criteria:
- WHEN load portfolio -- THEN see name, photo/avatar, about me section, work section, and contact section
- WHEN click links -- THEN UI scrolls to corresponding section
- WHEN click work -- THEN UI scrolls to section with titled images of developer's apps
- WHEN see first app -- THEN that app's image is larger in size than the others
    - (is this when you click or first impression, this app needs to be the largest on the screen?)
- WHEN click app images -- THEN taken to that deployed app
- WHEN page resized -- THEN responsive layout adapts

### To Do:
- √ Outline HTML
- √ Basic CSS
- √ Flexboxes
- √ Match client portfolio piece (but with my own content)
- √ Text over images
- Hover functionality
- Page for Resume
- Enhanced CSS (Shadows, variables)
- Ensure alt for all images
- Ensure links lead to appropriate id/page
- Ensure heading tags all in order
- Deploy app at live URL 
- Submit
 

Actual list:
- sticky header? 
- Hover aspects -- Navigation -- do I want it to change on hover? Perhaps text color change
- Shadow aspects
- Header bg fixed? and Position %?
- Check .hero div {...} overflow:auto
