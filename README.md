### Criteria:

- WHEN click links -- THEN UI scrolls to corresponding section
- WHEN click work -- THEN UI scrolls to section with titled images of developer's apps
- WHEN see first app -- THEN that app's image is larger in size than the others
    - (is this when you click or first impression, this app needs to be the largest on the screen?)
